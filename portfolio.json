The comprehensive guide walks through creating custom views for record creation, viewing, and editing, along with layouts and routes to create clean, custom URLs. The article provides step-by-step instructions for creating limited field views that work separately from stock record views, including code examples for view files, metadata definitions, layout configurations, and routing setup. The tutorial helps developers create custom data entry interfaces for teams that need simplified views without the complexity of full record layouts, and includes downloadable code examples for Sugar 9.0.0 Professional.",
